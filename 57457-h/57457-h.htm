<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>There were many quite different printings of this Book of
Husbandry. As the editor of this printing, Rev. Walter Skeat, notes
in his Introduction: “The present volume contains a careful reprint
of Berthelet’s edition of 1534” collated throughout “with the
curious edition of 1598” that was authored by “I. R.”&mdash;his actual
name is unknown.</p>

<p>This “careful reprint” retains all the spelling variations and
inconsistencies of those original editions, and so does this etext.
The Notes and Sidenotes produced by Skeat are of course in modern
(1882) English. He has inserted some corrections to the reprinted text;
these are shown in [brackets]. Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors
in his Notes and Sidenotes have been corrected after careful comparison with
other occurrences within the text and consultation of external
sources.</p>

<p>Some minor changes are listed at the <a href="#TN">end of the book.</a></p>

<p>Footnote anchors are denoted by [number], and the footnotes have been
placed at the end of each major section of the book.</p>

<p><span class="screenonly">The line numbering on each section of the reprinted 1534 text has been
retained and is shown as a number (4, 8, 12 etc) on the left side of
the etext. Original line-breaks in the 1534 text have not been retained.</span></p>

<p><span class="handonly">>The line numbering on each section of the reprinted 1534 text has been

<h2 class="no-brk"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="noindent">One question of chief interest respecting the volume here
printed is&mdash;who was the author? We know that his name
was “Mayster Fitzherbarde” (see p. 125), and the question
that has to be settled is simply this&mdash;may we identify him
with Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, judge of the Common Pleas,
the author of the Grand Abridgment of the Common Law,
the New Natura Brevium, and other legal works?</p>

<p>The question has been frequently discussed, and, as far as
I have been able to discover, the more usual verdict of the
critics is in favour of the supposed identity; and certainly all
the evidence tends very strongly in that direction, as will, I
think, presently appear.</p>

<p>Indeed, when we come to investigate the grounds on which
the objections to the usually received theory rest, they appear
to be exceedingly trivial; nor have I been very successful
in discovering the opposed arguments. Bohn’s edition of
Lowndes’ Bibliographer’s Manual merely tells us that “the
treatises on Husbandry and Surveying are by some attributed
to the famous lawyer Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, by others to
his brother John Fitzherbert.”</p>

<p>In the Catalogue of the Huth Library, we find this note:
“The Rev. Joseph Hunter was the first person to point out
that the author of this work [Fitzherbert’s Husbandry] and
the book on Surveying was a different person from the judge
of the same name.” It will be at once observed that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
note is practically worthless, from the absence of the reference.
After considerable search, I have been unable to
discover where Hunter’s statement is to be found, so that the
nature of his objections can only be guessed at.</p>

<p>In Walter Harte’s Essays on Husbandry (ii. 77) we read&mdash;“How
Fitzherbert could be a practitioner of the art of
agriculture for 40 years, as he himself says in 1534, is pretty
extraordinary. I suppose it was his country amusement in
the periodical recesses between the terms.” We are here
presented with a definite objection, grounded, as is alleged,
upon the author’s own words; and it is most probable that
Harte is here stating the objection which has weighed most
strongly with those who (like Hunter) have objected to the
current opinion. The answer to the objection is, I think,
not a little remarkable, viz. that the alleged statement is <em>not</em>
the author’s at all. By turning to p. 125, it will be seen that
it was Thomas Berthelet the printer who said that the author
“had exercysed husbandry, with greate experyence, xl. years.”
But the author’s <em>own</em> statement, on p. 124, is <em>differently
worded</em>; and the difference is material. He says: “and, as
touchynge the poyntes of husbandry, and of other artycles
conteyned in this present boke, I wyll not saye that it is the
beste waye and wyll serue beste in all places, but I saye it
is the best way that euer I coude proue by experyence, the
whiche haue <em>ben an housholder</em> this xl. yeres and more, and
haue assaied many and dyuers wayes, and done my dyligence
to proue by experyence which shuld be the beste waye.” The
more we weigh these words, the more we see a divergence
between them and the construction which might readily be
put upon the words of Berthelet; a construction which, in all
probability, Berthelet did not specially intend. Any reader
who hastily glances at Berthelet’s statement would probably
deduce from it that the author was a farmer merely, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
had forty years’ experience in farming. But this is not what
we should deduce from the more careful statement of the
author. We should rather notice these points.</p>

<p>1. The author does not speak of husbandry <em>only</em>, but of
<em>other points</em>. The other points are the breeding of horses
(not a necessary part of a farmer’s business), the selling of
wood and timber, grafting of trees, a long discourse upon
prodigality, remarks upon gaming, a discussion of “what is
riches,” and a treatise upon practical religion, illustrated by
Latin quotations from the fathers, and occupying no small
portion of the work. This is not the work of a practical
farmer, in the narrow acceptation of the term, meaning
thereby one who farms to live; but it is clearly the work of
a country gentleman, rich in horses and in timber, acquainted
with the extravagant mode of life often adopted by the
wealthy, and at the same time given to scholarly pursuits
and to learned and devout reading. Indeed, the prominence
given to religious teaching can hardly fail to surprise
a reader who expects to find in the volume nothing more
than hints upon practical agriculture. One chapter has a
very suggestive heading, viz. “A lesson made in Englysshe
verses, that <em>a gentylmans seruaunte</em> shall forget none of his
gere <em>in his inne behynde hym</em>” (p. 7). This is obviously the
composition of a gentleman himself, and of one accustomed
to take long journeys upon horseback, and to stay at various
inns on the way.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>2. Again he says, “it is the best way that euer I coude
proue by experyence, the whiche ... haue assaied <em>many
and dyuers</em> wayes, and done my dyligence to proue by
experyence which shuld be the beste waye.” Certainly this
is not the language of one who farmed for profit, but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
the <em>experimental</em> farmer, the man who could afford to lose if
things went wrong, one to whom farming was an amusement
and a recreation, and who delighted in trying various modes
that he might benefit those who, unlike himself, could not
afford to try any way but that which had long been known.</p>

<p>3. We must note the language in which he describes himself.
He does not say that he had “exercised husbandry”
for forty years, but that he had “been a householder” during
that period. The two things are widely different. His knowledge
of agriculture was, so to speak, accidental; his real
employment had been to manage a household, or, as we
should rather now say, to “keep house.” This, again, naturally
assigns to him the status of a country gentleman, who
chose to superintend everything for himself, and to gain a
practical acquaintance with everything upon his estate, viz.
his lands, his cattle, his horses, his bees, his trees, his felled
timber, and the rest; not forgetting his duties as a man of
rank in setting a good example, discouraging waste, giving
attention to prayer and almsgiving, and to his necessary
studies. “He that can rede and vnderstande <em>latyne</em>, let hym
take his booke in his hande, and looke stedfastely vppon the
same thynge that he readeth and seeth, <em>that is no trouble to
hym</em>,” etc. (p. 115). Are we to suppose that it could be said
generally, of farmers in the time of Henry VIII., that Latin
was “no trouble to them”? If so, things must have greatly
changed.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the above matter at some length, because
I much suspect that the words used by Berthelet are the very
words which have biassed, entirely in the wrong direction,
the minds of such critics as have found a difficulty where
little exists. It ought to be particularly borne in mind that
Berthelet’s expression, though likely to mislead <em>now</em>, was not
calculated to do so at the time, when the authorship of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
book was doubtless well known. And we shall see presently
that Berthelet himself entirely believed Sir Anthony to have
been the author of this Book on Husbandry.</p>

<p>Another objection that has been raised is founded upon the
apparent strangeness of the title “Mayster Fitz-herbarde” as
applied to a judge. The answer is most direct and explicit,
viz. that the printer who uses this title did so wittingly, for
he is <em>the very man</em> who helps us to identify our author with
the great lawyer. It is therefore simply impossible that he
could have seen any incongruity in it, and any objection
founded upon it must be wholly futile. The title of <em>master</em>
was used in those days very differently to what it is now.
Foxe, in his Actes and Monuments, ed. 1583, p. 1770, tells us
how “maister Latymer” encouraged “maister Ridley,” when
both were at the stake; and, chancing to open Holinshed’s
History (ed. 1808, iii. 754), I find a discourse between Wolsey
and Sir William Kingston, Constable of the Tower, in which
the latter is called “master Kingston” throughout.</p>

<p>I cannot find that there is any reason for assigning the
composition of the Book of Husbandry to John Fitzherbert,
Sir Anthony’s brother. It is a mere guess, founded only
upon the knowledge that Sir Anthony had such a brother. It
looks as though the critics who wish to deprive Sir Anthony
of the honour of the authorship think they must concede
somewhat, and therefore suggest his brother’s name by way
of compensation.</p>

<p>We have no proof that John Fitzherbert ever wrote anything,
whilst Sir Anthony was a well-known author. All
experience shows that a man who writes one book is likely
to write another.</p>

<p>When we leave these vague surmises and come to consider
the direct evidence, nearly all difficulties cease. And first, as
to external evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>The author of the Book of Husbandry was also author of
the Book of Surveying, as has always been seen and acknowledged.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The first piece of distinct evidence on the subject
is the statement of Thomas Berthelet. He prefixed some
verses to Pynson’s edition of the Book of Surveying (1523),
addressing the reader as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse0">“ &nbsp;This worthy man / nobly hath done his payne</p>
<p class="verse2">I meane hym / that these sayde bokes<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> dyd deuyse.</p>
<p class="verse2">He sheweth to husbandes / in right fruteful wyse</p>
<p class="verse2">The manyfolde good thynges / in brefe sentence</p>
<p class="verse2">Whiche he hath well proued / by long experyence.</p>
<p class="verse0">¶ &nbsp;And this<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I leaue hym / in his good wyll and mynde</p>
<p class="verse2">That he beareth / vnto the publyke weale.</p>
<p class="verse2">Wolde god <em>noblemen</em> / coude in their hertes fynde</p>
<p class="verse2"><em>After such forme</em> / <em>for the cōmons helth</em> to deale;</p>
<p class="verse2">It is a true token / <em>of hyghe loue and zeale</em></p>
<p class="verse2">Whan <em>he</em> so delyteth / and taketh pleasure</p>
<p class="verse2">By his busy labour / <em>mens welth to procure</em>.”</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This cannot well be mistaken. It is obvious that Berthelet
believed the author to be a <em>nobleman</em>, one who “shewed
things to husbands” which he had gained by his own “long
experience;” one who wrote out of the “good will and mind
that he bare unto the public weal,” thereby proving his
“high love and zeal,” in that he delighted “to procure men’s
wealth,” <em>i.e.</em> the welfare of others, not his own riches, by
means of his “busy labour.” We hence conclude that Berthelet
knew perfectly well who the author was; and indeed
it would have been strange if he did not, since he was
writing in 1523 (while the author was still alive), and subsequently
printed both the books of which he is here speaking.
He plainly tells us that the author was a nobleman, and
merely wrote to benefit others out of pure love and zeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>But this is not Berthelet’s only allusion to these books. In
an edition of the Book of Surveying, printed by Berthelet,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
there are some remarks by him at the back of the title-page
to the following effect. “To the reder. Whan I had printed
the boke longyng to a Justice of the peace, togither with
other small bokes very necessary, I bethought me vpon this
boke of Surueyenge, compyled sometyme by master Fitzherbarde,
how good and howe profitable it is for all states,
that be lordes and possessioners of landes, ... or tenauntes
of the same, ... also how well it agreeth with the argume<em>n</em>t
of the other small bokes, as court-baron, court-hundred, and
chartuary, I went in hande and printed it in the same
volume that the other be, to binde them al-togither. And
haue amended it in many places.”</p>

<p>The mention of “the boke longyng to a Justice of the
peace” is interesting, as bringing us back again to Sir Anthony
Fitzherbert. “In 1538,” says Mr. Wallis,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Robert Redman
printed “The newe Boke of Justices of the Peas, by A. F. K.
[Anthony Fitzherbert, Knight], lately translated out of French
into English, In the yere of our Lord God, M.D.xxxviii.
The 29 day of December, Cum priuilegio.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Mr. Hobson’s
list (Hist. Ashborne, p. 234) mentions this as “the first work
on the subject ever printed,” but this is not the case.
Wynkyn de Worde and Copland both printed, as early as
1515, “The Boke of Justices of the Peas, the charge, with al
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>the proces of the Cessyons, Warrants, Superseders, wyth al
that longyth to ony justice, &amp;c.” It is not pretended that
this was our author’s work; but he improved upon it, as he
did also upon the Natura Brevium. In his preface to La
Novel Natura Brevium (Berthelet, 1534), he says that the
original book was written by a learned man, whom he does
not name: and that it was esteemed as a fundamental book
for understanding the law. In the course of its translations,
and of the alteration of the laws, many things had been
retained which were unnecessary, and much desirable matter
was omitted. This was what induced him to compose the
new one.</p>

<p>Upon this I have to remark, that it is incredible that
Berthelet should mention a work which he knew to be by Sir
Anthony Fitzherbert in one line, and in the next should
proceed to speak of “Master Fitzherbarde” without a word
of warning that he was speaking of a different person. The
obvious inference is that the author of the Book on Surveying
was, in his belief, the same person as the “A. F. K.” who
wrote “the boke longyng to a Justice of the peace.” As it is,
he takes no trouble about the matter; for he could hardly
foresee that any difficulty would thence arise. It is remarkable
how frequently writers just stop short of being explicit,
because they think that, at the moment of writing, a fact is
too notorious to be worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Here the direct external evidence ceases. We now come
to consider the internal evidence, which is interesting enough.</p>

<p>In the first place, the author of the Book of Husbandry
was also the author of the Book of Surveying, as he tells us
explicitly in his prologue to the latter book. But whoever
wrote the Book of Surveying must have been a considerable
lawyer. It is of a far more learned and technical character
than the Book on Husbandry, and abounds with quotations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
from Latin statutes, which the author translates and explains.
In Chap. 1 he says of a certain statute, that, <em>in his opinion</em>,
it was made soon after the Battle of Evesham, in the time of
Henry III.; and he frequently interprets statutes with the air
of one whose opinion was worth having. In Chap, xi., he
enlarges upon the mistakes made by lords, knights, squires,
and gentlemen who know but little of the law. “They come
to the court or sende their clerkes, that can [know] as litle
law as their maister or lasse, but that he vnderstandeth a lytell
latyn.” At the end of the same chapter, he is deep in law-terms,
court-roll, fee simple, fee tayle, franke tenement, and
all the rest of it. He then gives numerous forms, all in
Latin, to be used by owners who wish to lease, grant, or
surrender lands; but only a good lawyer would venture to
recommend forms suitable for such important purposes.</p>

<p>Some other points of internal evidence have already been
incidentally noticed, such as the author’s familiarity with the
mode of life of the rich; his lesson made for “a gentylmans
seruaunte”; his readiness to try many ways of farming as an
experimentalist who could afford to lose money; and his
statement that Latin was no trouble to him. I proceed to
notice a few more.</p>

<p>Something further can be inferred from the author’s mention
of places. He speaks of so many counties, as Cornwall,
Devon, Essex, Kent, Somerset, Buckinghamshire, Yorkshire,
and Lancashire, that we can at first obtain no definite result.
But there is an express allusion to “the peeke countreye” at
p. 44; whilst at p. 81 he alludes to the parts about London
by using the adverb “there,” as if it were <em>not</em> his home. Yet
that he was perfectly familiar with London is obvious from his
allusions to it in chap. xix. of the Book on Surveying. But
there are two more explicit references which are worth notice.
At p. 27, he speaks of “the <em>farther syde</em> of Darbyshyre, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Scaresdale, Halomshyre, and so <em>northewarde</em> towarde Yorke
and Ryppon.” Now Scarsdale is one of the six “hundreds”
of Derbyshire, and includes the country about Dronfield and
Chesterfield; whilst Hallamshire is a name given to a part of
Yorkshire lying round and including Sheffield. We hence
fairly deduce the inference that the author lived on the <em>western
side of Derbyshire</em>, in the neighbourhood of Ashborne, so that
he looked upon Chesterfield as lying on the <em>farther</em> side of
the country, and at the same time <em>northward</em>, which is
precisely the fact. We are thus led to locate the author in
the very neighbourhood of Sir Anthony Fitzherbert’s home.</p>

<p>Again, at p. 65, he says that if he were to say too much
about the faults of horses, he would break the promise that
he made “at Grombalde brydge,” the first time that he went
to Ripon to buy colts. After some search as to the place
here intended, I found, in Allen’s History of Yorkshire, that
one of the bridges over the Nidd near Knaresborough is called
“Grimbald bridge;”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and, seeing that Knaresborough is
exactly due south of Ripon, it follows that the author came
from the south of Knaresborough. We seem, in fact, to trace
the general direction of his first ride to Ripon, viz. from his
home to the farther side of Derbyshire, through the northwest
corner of Scarsdale to Sheffield, and “so northward”
through Leeds and Knaresborough. Nothing can be more
satisfactory.</p>

<p>A very interesting point is the author’s love of farming and
of horses. As to horses, he tells us how he first went to
Ripon to buy colts (p. 65); how many secrets of horse-dealing
he could tell; how, in buying horses, he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
beguiled a hundred times and more (p. 63); how he used to
say to his customers that, if ever they ventured to trust any
horse-dealer, they had better trust himself (p. 73); and how
he had in his possession at one time as many as sixty mares,
and five or six horses (p. 60). In this connection, it becomes
interesting to inquire if Sir Anthony Fitzherbert was fond
of horses likewise.</p>

<p>It so happens that this question can certainly be answered
in the affirmative; and I have here to acknowledge, with
pleasure and gratitude, the assistance which I have received
from one of the family,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the Rev. Reginald Fitzherbert, of
Somersal Herbert, Derbyshire. He has been at the trouble
of transcribing Sir Anthony’s will, a complete copy of which
he contributed to “The Reliquary,” No. 84, vol. xxi. April,
1881, p. 234. I here insert, by his kind permission, his
remarks upon the subject, together with such extracts from
the will as seem most material for our present purpose.</p>

<p>“The following will of Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, of Norbury,
is transcribed from the Office Copy at Somerset House
(Dingley, fol. 20), and is now printed, as I believe, for the
first time. The contractions have been written out <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</i>.</p>

<p>“Sir Anthony married, secondly, the co-heir of Richard
Cotton, and with her he acquired the estate of Hampstall
Ridware, which he probably kept in his own hands, and
farmed himself. He succeeded his brother John at Norbury
in 1531, and died there in 1538, aged 68.</p>

<p>“Fuller, in his <cite>Worthies</cite>, says that Sir Anthony Fitzherbert’s
books are ‘monuments which will longer continue
his Memory than the flat blew marble stone in Norbury
Church under which he lieth interred.’ Camden (Gibson’s
ed. 1753, vol. i. p. 271) calls him <em>Chief Justice</em> of the Common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
Pleas; but Thoroton (Notts., ed. 1677, p. 344) says, ‘I do not
find that Anthony Fitzherbert was ever Chief Justice;’ and
it does not appear that he was more than, as he describes
himself, ‘oon of the kings Justices.’”</p>

<p>The will was proved at Lichfield, August 26, 1538.</p>

<p>I may add that the will mentions his wife dame Maude,
his son Thomas, his three younger sons John, Richard, and
William, and his daughter Kateryn; also his cousin Richard
Coton and his wife Alice. Thomas Fitzherbert married the
daughter of Sir Arthur Eyre.</p>

<p>It hence appears that Sir Anthony had no less than <em>three
farms</em>, one at Castleton in the Peak, one at Caldon in
Staffordshire, near Dove Dale, and a farm which he held of
the King; besides the How Grange and some land at Whittington
near Lichfield, as also some purchased lands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
tenements in the counties of Stafford, Northampton, and
Warwick, mentioned in a part of the will which I have not
quoted. There was also the estate of Hampstall Ridware in
Staffordshire, to which he attached considerable importance,
directing his heir-looms to be kept there. He also makes
mention, in all, of <em>six horses</em> (including a stallion and two
geldings), <em>twelve mares</em>, <em>three colts</em>, <em>one bull</em>, <em>four bullocks</em>, <em>five
heifers</em>, <em>eight oxen</em>, and <em>ten cows</em>, though it is obvious that
these by no means include all his stock, but merely a selection
from it. All this precisely agrees with the statements
in the Book of Husbandry.</p>

<p>I do not think it necessary to pursue the subject further,
but a word must be added as to the chronology. Not having
seen the first edition of the Book of Husbandry printed by
Pynson in 1523, I cannot certainly say whether the statement
that the author had “been a householder for 40 years” occurs
there. It occurs, however, in an undated edition by Peter
Treuerys,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which is certainly the <em>second</em> edition, and printed
between 1521 and 1531, as Treuerys is only known to have
printed books during that period. Now this edition professes
to have corrections and additions, the title being&mdash;“Here
bygynneth a newe tracte or treatis moost p<em>ro</em>fytable for all
husba<em>n</em>de men / and very [frutefu]ll for all other persones
to rede / newly cor[rected] &amp; amended by the auctour with to
dyuerse other thynges added thervnto;” and it agrees very
closely with the copy here printed. The date assigned for
Sir Anthony Fitzherbert’s birth is 1470. If we suppose him
to have begun housekeeping at 21, a period of 40 years will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
bring us to 1531, which is not inconsistent with his statement,
if such be the date of the copy above mentioned. If, however,
it should appear that the statement exists even in the
first edition printed in 1523, then the “forty years” would
lead us to suppose that, if the assigned date of his birth be
correct, Sir Anthony began to be a householder, in his own
estimation, at the early age of twelve or thirteen. This is
of course a difficulty, but not an insuperable one, for the
phrase “have been a householder” is somewhat vague, and
the phrase “forty years or more” has rather the air of a
rhetorical flourish.</p>

<p>It may here be noticed that Berthelet’s first edition (here
reprinted) has nothing on the title-page but the words “<span class="smcap">The
Boke of Hvsbandry</span>,” with the date 1534 below. Later
reprints which follow Berthelet have accordingly no statement
as to the book being “newly corrected and amended by the
auctour,” etc.; whilst those which follow Treuerys naturally
copy it. This accounts for the fact that the later editions are,
to the best of my belief, all very much the same, and that the
claim to possess “corrections and amendments” means practically
nothing, except with reference to the <em>first</em> edition only.</p>

<p>Of Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, one of the best accounts
seems to be that given in the Biographia Britannica, 1750,
vol. iii. p. 1935, where Camden’s statement as to his being
“Chief Justice” is refuted. Briefly recapitulated, this account
tells us that he was born in 1470, and was the younger son of
Ralph Fitzherbert, Esq., of Norbury in Derbyshire; that he
went to Oxford, and thence to the Inns of Court; was made
a serjeant-at-law, Nov. 18, 1511; was knighted in 1516; was
made one of his majesty’s serjeants-at-law, and finally one of
the Justices of the Court of Common Pleas in 1523. He died
May 27, 1538, and was buried at Norbury. “Two things are
mentioned in reference to his conduct; first, that, without fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
of his power, he openly opposed Cardinal Wolsey in the
heighth of his favour; the other, that, when he came to lie
upon his death-bed, foreseeing the changes that were like to
happen in the Church as well as State, he pressed his children
in very strong terms to promise him solemnly, neither to
accept grants, nor to make purchases of abbey-lands; which
it is said they did, and adhered constantly to that promise,
though much to their own loss.” The authorities referred to
are Pits, De Illustribus Angliæ Scriptoribus, p. 707; Wood,
Athenæ Oxonienses, i. col. 50; Fuller, Worthies, Derbyshire,
p. 233; Tanner, Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica, p. 283;
Chronica Juridicialia, pp. 153, 155., etc.</p>

<p>The number of editions of the Book of Husbandry is so
large, and many of these are nevertheless so scarce, that I do
not suppose the list here subjoined is exhaustive; nor have
I much information about some of them. I merely mention
what I have found, with some authorities.</p>

<p>1. A newe tracte or treatyse moost profytable for all
Husbandemen, and very frutefull for all other persons to
rede. London: by Rycharde Pynson. 4to. (1523). See Typographical
Antiquities, by Ames and Herbert, ed. Dibdin, ii.
503. This is the <em>first</em> edition, and very rare. It was described
by Dibdin from Heber’s copy, supposed to be unique. See
Heber’s Catalogue, part ix. p. 61. The note in Hazlitt that
a copy of this edition is in the Bodleian Library is a mistake,
as I have ascertained. It is not dated, but the Book on
Surveying, printed just afterwards, is dated 1523; and there
is no doubt as to the date. It is remarkable for an engraving
upon the title-page, representing two oxen drawing a plough,
with drivers.</p>

<p>2. “Here begynneth a newe tracte,” etc. (See p. xx.)
London, Southwark; by P. Treuerys, 4to. (No date; but

is the only other edition which (as far as I know) has the

<p>3. By Thomas Berthelet, in 1532 (Lowndes). It is “12mo
in size, but in eights by signatures,” and therefore 8vo. (A.
Wallis; Derby Mercury, Nov. 1869).</p>

<p>4. By Thomas Berthelet; 8vo.; the edition here reprinted
from the copy in the Cambridge University Library. There
are also two copies of it in the Bodleian Library at Oxford.
The title-page has merely the words: “<span class="smcap">The | Boke of |
Hvs- | bandry</span>;” printed within a border bearing the date
1534. The reverse of the title-page is blank. On the
second leaf, marked A ij, begins “The aucthors prologue.”
The rest of sheet A (which contains in all only <em>six</em> leaves)
is occupied with the Prologue and “the Table;” and is not
foliated. Then follow sheets B to M, all of <em>eight</em> leaves, and
sheet N, of <em>two</em> leaves only. Sheets B to H have the folios
numbered from 1 to 56; sheets I, K, L have the folios numbered
from 51 to 75; and sheets M and N, from 81 to 90. Thus
the six numbers 51&ndash;56 occur twice over, and the five numbers
76&ndash;80 do not occur at all. It is not quite certain that the
apparent date is also the real one; for at the end of Berthelet’s
print of Xenophon’s treatise of Housholde, which
has 1534 within the same border upon the title-page, there
is a colophon giving the date as 1537. This border was
evidently in use for at least three years. See Dibdin, iii. 287.</p>

<p>5. By Berthelet; 1546. This edition also contains the
Treatise on Surveying. (Lowndes; compare Dibdin, iii. 348.)</p>

<p>6. By Berthelet; 1548. (Lowndes; Dibdin, iii. 334, where
it is described as 12mo.) A copy of this is noticed in the
Catalogue of the Huth Library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>7. By Thomas Marshe; (1560). This edition is said to be
“newly corrected and amended by the author, Fitzherbarde;”
but is, of course, a mere reprint. See remarks upon this
above. (Lowndes; Dibdin, iv. 534.) In Arber’s Transcript
of the Stationers’ Registers, i. 128, we find&mdash;“Recevyd
of <em>Thomas Marshe</em> for his lycense for pryntinge of a boke
Called the boke of husbondry, graunted the xx of June
[1560] ... iiij. <em>d.</em>” Hence the date, which is not given, may
be inferred.</p>

Of this book I shall say more below. I have used the copy
in the Douce Collection in the Bodleian Library.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>11. etc. There are numerous other editions. Hazlitt mentions
one by R. Kele (no date), “newlye corrected and
amended by the auctor Fitzherbarde, with dyuers additions
put therunto.” Lowndes says: “London, by Richard Kele,
16mo. There are two editions, one containing H, the other I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
in eights.” Dibdin (iii. 533) mentions one by John Wayland,
8vo. (no date), Lowndes mentions an edition printed at
London “in the Hovs of Tho. Berthelet,” 16mo.; eighty
leaves; also&mdash;another edition, slightly differing in orthography,
and having at the end “Cum privilegio;” also
another “in the House of Thomas Berthelet,” 16mo. A, 6
leaves, B&mdash;M, in eights, N, 2 leaves, with the date of 1534
on the title-page; but this can be nothing else than the very
book here reprinted, and it is not clear why he mentions it
again. Lowndes also notices undated editions by John
Walley, Robert Toye, Jugge, and Myddylton.</p>

<p>It hence appears that the book was frequently reprinted
between 1523 and 1598, but the last of these editions was
such as to destroy its popularity, and I am not aware that it
was ever again reprinted except in 1767, when the Books on
Husbandry and Surveying were reprinted together<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> in a form
strongly resembling the edition of 1534.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The title of this
book is&mdash;“Certain Ancient Tracts concerning the management
of Landed Property reprinted. London, printed for
C. Bathurst and J. Newbery; 1767.” This is a fairly good
reprint, with the old spelling carefully preserved; but has
neither note nor comment of any kind. A copy of it kindly
lent me by Mr. Furnivall has proved very useful.</p>

<p>The editions of the Book on Surveying are almost as
numerous as those of the Book on Husbandry, though this
was hardly to be expected, considering its more learned and
technical character. It is not necessary to speak here particularly
of Sir Anthony Fitzherbert’s acknowledged works.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>The most important are the Grand Abridgment of the
Common Law (1514, folio), Office of Justices of the Peace
(1538), Diversity of Courts (1539), and the New Natura
Brevium, of which the ninth edition, with a commentary by
Lord Hale, appeared in 1794. The first edition of the Grand
Abridgment was printed by Pynson, who was also the printer
of the first edition of the Book of Husbandry. The New
Natura Brevium was printed in 1534 by Berthelet, who reprinted
the Book of Husbandry in the same year. In a
bookseller’s catalogue, March, 1880, I chanced to see the
following. “Early English Printing; Black Letter; Law
Books in Latin and Norman-French (1543&ndash;51). Natura
Brevium; newely and most trewely corrected with diverse
additio<em>n</em>s of statutes bokes cases plees in abatements, etc.;
London, Wyllyam Powel, 1551.&mdash;Articuli ad Narrationes
novas; London, W. Powel, 1547.&mdash;Diuersite de courtz et lour
jurisdiccions, et alia necessaria et utilia, London, W. Myddylton,
1543. The three works in 1 vol., sm. 8vo., old calf
neat, quite perfect and very rare, 21<em>s.</em>”</p>

<p>The present volume contains a careful reprint of Berthelet’s
edition of 1534, which is a fairly good one. I have collated
it throughout with the curious edition of 1598, which abounds
with “corrections,” some of them no improvements, and with
additional articles. It is a very curious book, and I have
given all the more interesting variations in the notes, with
a description of the additions. The author, who only gives
his initials “I. R.” (by which initials I have been often obliged
to quote him<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>) has the effrontery to tell us that he has reduced
Fitzherbert’s work “into a more pleasing forme of English
then before;” and says that he has “labored to purge the
same fro<em>m</em> the barbarisme of the former times.” Again he
addresses the reader, saying&mdash;“Gentle Reader, being vrged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
by the consideration of the necessitie of this worke, and
finding it almost cast into perpetuall obliuion, I haue purged
it from the first forme of missounding termes to our daintie
eares.” This means, of course, that he has altered terms
which he did not understand, and occasionally turns sense
into nonsense; yet he seems to have taken considerable pains
with his author, and his additions are frequently to the point.
Whether his discourses upon the keeping of poultry (p. 145,
note to sect. 144) were really due to his “owne experience
in byrds and foules,” or whether he copied much of it from
some of his predecessors, I have not been curious to discover.
His references to Virgil, to the fable of Cynthia and Endymion,
the Cinyphian goats, and the rest, are in the worst
possible taste, and he was evidently far too staunch a Protestant
to be able to accept all Fitzherbert’s religious views,
though modestly and unobtrusively introduced. After carefully
reading his production, I infinitely prefer Fitzherbert’s
“barbarisme” to I. R.’s pedantic mannerism, and I find the
patronising tone of his occasionally stupid amendments to
be almost insufferable; but he may be forgiven for his zeal.
The art of sinking in poetry has rarely been so well exemplified
as in the verses which are printed at pp. 145 and
148.</p>

<p>The reader can best understand what I. R. conceives to be
elegance of style by comparing the following extract with
section 1 at p. 9.</p>

<p class="center">“<em>Chapter 2.</em> ¶ <em>By what a Husbandman cheefely liueth.</em></p>

<p>The most generall and <em>commonest experienst liuing</em> that the
<em>toyle-imbracing</em> Husbandman liueth by, is either by plowing
and sowing of his Corne, or by rearing and breeding of
Cattell, and not the one without the other, <em>because they be
adjuncts, and may not be disceuered</em>. Then sithens that the
Plough is the first good instrument, by which the Husband-men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
<em>rips from the Earths wombe a well-pleasing liuing, I
thinke</em> it is most conuenient first to speake of the <em>forme,
fashion, and</em> making therof.”</p>

<p>The words italicised (except in the title) are all his own.</p>

<p>The Glossarial Index, a very full one, was almost entirely
prepared, in the first instance, by my eldest daughter, though
I have since added a few explanations in some cases, and
have revised the whole, at the same time verifying the references.
As to the meaning of a few terms, I am still uncertain.</p>

<p>Fitzherbert’s general style is plain, simple, and direct, and
he evidently has the welfare of his reader at heart, to whom
he offers kindly advice in a manner least calculated to give
offence. He is in general grave and practical, but there are
a few touches of quiet humour in his remarks upon horse-dealing.
“Howe be it I saye to my customers, and those
that bye any horses of me, and [<em>if</em>] euer they wil trust any
hors-master or corser whyle they lyue, truste me.” I would
have trusted him implicitly.</p>

<p>The difficulties of his language arise almost entirely from
the presence of numerous technical terms; and it is, indeed,
this fact that renders his book one of considerable philological
interest, and adapts it for publication by the English Dialect
Society. By way of a small contribution to English etymology,
I beg leave to take a single instance, and to consider
what he has to tell us about the word <em>peruse</em>.</p>

<p>The whole difficulty as to the etymology of this word
arises from the change of sense; it is now used in such a way
that the derivation from <em>per-</em> and <em>use</em> is not obvious; nor does
it commend itself to such as are unacquainted with historical
method. For this reason, some etymologists, including
Webster, have imagined that it arose from <em>peruise</em> = <em>pervise</em>
to see thoroughly, the <em>i</em> being dropped, and the <em>u</em> (really <em>v</em>)
being mistaken for the vowel. This is one of those wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
unscrupulous fictions to which but too many incline, as if the
cause of truth could ever be helped forward by means of
deliberate invention. But there is no such word as <em>peruise</em>,
nor any French <em>perviser</em>. Fitzherbert is one of the earliest
authorities for <em>peruse</em>, though it also occurs in Skelton, Philip
Sparrow, l. 814. Investigation will show that, at the commencement
of the sixteenth century, there was a fashion of
using words compounded with <em>per-</em>, a number of which I have
given in my Dictionary, s. v. <em>peruse</em>. The old sense was ‘to
use up, to go through thoroughly, to attend to one by one;’
and the word was sometimes spelt with a <em>v</em>, because <em>vse</em> (<em>use</em>)
was generally so spelt. Examples are:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Let hym [i.e. the husbandman who wants to reckon the
tithe of his corn] goo to the ende of his lande, and begynne
and tell [i.e. count] .ix. sheues, and let hym caste out the .x.
shefe in the name of god, and so to <em>pervse</em> from lande to lande,
tyll he have trewely tythed all his corne;” sect. 30, l. 4.</p>

<p>“And thus [let the shepherd] <em>peruse</em> them all tyll he haue
doone;” sect. 40, l. 23.</p>

<p>“Than [let the surveyor who is surveying property go] to
the second howse on the same east side in lyke maner, and so
to <em>peruse</em> from house to house tyll he come to St. Magnus
churche;” Book of Surveying (1767), chap. xix.</p>

<p>“Begyn to plowe a forowe in the middes of the side of
the land, and cast it downe as yf thou shulde falowe it, and
so <em>peruse</em> both sydes tyl the rygge be cast down,” etc.; Book
of Surveying (1767); chap. xxiv.</p>

<p>The special application to a book may be seen in Baret’s
Alvearie: “To ouerlooke and <em>peruse</em> a booke againe, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Retractare
librum</i>.” And accordingly it need not surprise us
that Levins, in 1570, translated <em>to peruse</em> by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peruti</i>.</p>

<p>There is just one more suggestion which I venture to make,
though I fear, like most conjectures which are made with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
respect to Shakespeare, it is probably valueless. When King
Lear appears, in Act iv. sc. 4&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">“Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,</p>
<p class="verse0">With <em>hor-docks</em>, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,</p>
<p class="verse0">Darnel, and <em>all the idle weeds that grow</em></p>
<p class="verse0"><em>In our sustaining corn</em>”&mdash;</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I cannot help being reminded of Fitzherbert’s list of weeds
in sect. 20 (p. 29), in which he includes <em>haudoddes</em>, <em>i.e.</em> corn
blue-bottles, as is obvious from his description; see also
Britten and Holland’s English Plant-names. It is certainly
remarkable that the <em>haudod</em> is precisely one of “the idle
weeds that grow in corn,” and that its bright colour would
be particularly attractive to the gatherer of a wild garland.
We must not, however, overlook the form <em>hardhake</em>, which
Mr. Wright has found in a MS. herbal as a name for the
knapweed; see his note upon the passage. The two results
do not, however, greatly differ, and it is conceivable that the
same name could be applied at different times to <em>both</em> these
flowers, the latter being <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centaurea nigra</i>, and the former
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centaurea Cyanus</i>. We also find the term <em>hardewes</em>, occurring
as a name for the wild succory; see <em>Hawdod</em> in the
Glossarial Index, p. 156. In any case, the proposal of Dr.
Prior to explain <em>hordock</em> by the burdock (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arctium lappa</i>),
merely because he thinks the burs were sometimes entangled
with flax, and so formed lumps in it called <em>hards</em>, is
a wild guess that should be rejected. <em>Hards</em> are simply
the coarse parts of flax, without any reference to burdocks
whatever.</p>

<p>The wood-cut on the title-page is copied from the edition
of 1598. The longer handle of the plough is on the left.

&nbsp;&nbsp;
The mooste generall lyuynge that husbandes can haue,
is by plowynge and sowyng of theyr cornes, and rerynge
or bredynge of theyr cattel, and not the one withoute
the other. Than is the ploughe the moste necessaryest <span class="linenum">4</span>

it is conuenyent to be knowen, howe a plough shulde

<h3>2. ¶ Dyuers maners of plowes.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Different

&nbsp;&nbsp;
There be plowes of dyuers makynges in dyuers

maner of groundes and soyles. Some whyte cley, some <span class="linenum">4</span>
redde cley, some grauell or chylturne, some sande, some
meane erthe, some medled with marle, and in many
places heeth-grounde, and one ploughe wyll not serue
in all places. Wherfore it is necessarye, to haue dyuers <span class="linenum">8</span>
<div class="sidenote">[Fol. 1<em>b</em>.]<br />
Somersetshire.</div>

maners of plowes. In Sommersetshyre, about Zelcester,
the sharbeame, that in many places is called the ploughe-hedde,
is foure or fyue foote longe, and it is brode and
thynne. And that is bycause the lande is verye toughe, <span class="linenum">12</span>
and wolde soke the ploughe into the erthe, yf the sharbeame
<div class="sidenote">Kent.</div>

were not long, brode, and thynne. In Kente
they haue other maner of plowes, somme goo with
wheles, as they doo in many other places, and some wyll <span class="linenum">16</span>
tourne the sheldbredth at euery landes ende, and plowe

of an nother maner, and also other maner of ploughe-yrons,
the whyche me semeth generally good, and lykely <span class="linenum">20</span>
to serue in many places, and specially if the ploughbeame
and sharbeame be foure ynches longer, betwene the
shethe and the ploughe-tayle, that the sheldbrede myght
come more a-slope: for those plowes gyue out to sodeinly, <span class="linenum">24</span>
and therfore they be the worse to drawe, and for noo
<div class="sidenote">Leicestershire,
&amp;c.</div>

cause elles. In Leycestershyre, Lankesshyre, Yorkeshyre,
Lyncoln, Norfolke, Cambrydge-shyre, and manye other
countreyes, the plowes be of dyuers makinges, the whyche <span class="linenum">28</span>

so euer they be made, yf they be well tempered, and

<h3>6. ¶ Whether is better, a plough of horses or a plough of
oxen.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Ox-plough
and horse-plough.</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is to be knowen, whether is better, a plough of
horses, or a plough of oxen, and therin me semeth
oughte to be made a distinction. For in some places an
oxe-ploughe is better than a horse-plough, and in somme <span class="linenum">4</span>
places a horse-ploughe is better: that is to say, in euery
place where-as the husband hath seueral pastures to put
his oxen in whan they come fro theyr warke, there the oxe-ploughe
<div class="sidenote">The ox.</div>

is better. For an oxe maye nat endure his <span class="linenum">8</span>
<div class="sidenote">[Fol. 6.]</div>

warke, to labour all daye, and than to be put to the
commons, or before the herdman, and to be set in a folde
all nyghte without meate, and go to his labour in
the mornynge. But and he be put in a good pasture all <span class="linenum">12</span>
nyghte, he wyll labour moche of all the daye dayely.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
And oxen wyl plowe in tough cley, and vpon hylly
grounde, where-as horses wyll stande st[i]ll. And where-as
<div class="sidenote">The horse.</div>

is noo seuerall pastures, there the horse-plowe is better, <span class="linenum">16</span>
for the horses may be teddered or tyed vpon leys, balkes,
or hades, where as oxen maye not be kept: and it is not
vsed to tedder them, but in fewe places.
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
And horses wyl goo faster than oxen on euen grounde <span class="linenum">20</span>
or lyght grounde, &amp; be quicker for cariage: but they be
ferre more costly to kepe in winter, for they must haue both
hey and corne to eate, and strawe for lytter; they must
be well shodde on all foure fete, and the gere that they <span class="linenum">24</span>
shal drawe with is more costely than for the oxen, and
<div class="sidenote">Oxen are
cheap,</div>

shorter whyle it wyll last. And oxen wyll eate but straw,
and a lyttell hey, the whiche is not halfe the coste that
horsis must haue, and they haue no shoes, as horses haue. <span class="linenum">28</span>
And if any sorance come to the horse, or [he] waxe olde,
broysed, or blynde, than he is lyttell worthe. And if any
sorance come to an oxe, [and he] waxe olde, broysed, or
<div class="sidenote">[Fol. 6<em>b</em>.]</div>

<div class="sidenote">and they can

meate, and as good or better than euer he was. And the
horse, whan he dyethe, is but caryen. And therfore me
semeth, all thynges consydered, the ploughe of oxen is
moche more profytable than the ploughe of horses. <span class="linenum">36</span>

Thou shalt sowe thy peas vpon the cley-grounde,

&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bvt yet me thynkethe it is necessarye to declare, howe
all maner of corne shuld be sowen, and howe moch
vpon an acre most comonly, and fyrste of pease and
<div class="sidenote">An acre of
ground.</div>

beanes. An acre of grounde, by the statute, that is to say <span class="linenum">4</span>
xvi. fote and a half to the perche or pole, foure perches
to an acre in bredth, and fortye perches to an acre in
<div class="sidenote">London
bushels.</div>

lengthe, may be metelye well sowen with two London
busshelles of pease, the whyche is but two strykes in <span class="linenum">8</span>

wylle it haue halfe a London bushelle more: and yf it be
halfe beanes, it wyll haue thre London bushels: and if it
be all beanes, it wyll haue foure London busshelles fullye, <span class="linenum">12</span>
and that is half a quarter; bycause the beanes be gret, and
grow vp streight, &amp; do not sprede and go abrode as
<div class="sidenote">Beans worth
more than
peas.</div>

pease do. An acre of good beanes is worth an acre &amp; a
half of good pees, bycause there wylle be more busshelles. <span class="linenum">16</span>

and specially beanes and barley. For commonly they be
sowen vpon ranke ground, and good grounde wylle haue <span class="linenum">20</span>

<div class="sidenote">[Fol. 10<em>b</em>.]</div>

sowe thervppon but oone busshelle, as yf he sowed .iiii.

bushels, that he sowed more, be alowed and set aparte.
<div class="sidenote">White,

And i. busshel and an halfe of white or grene pees, wyll
sowe as moche grounde, as two busshels of gray pees: <span class="linenum">28</span>
and that is bycause they be so smal, and the husband
nedeth not to take so great an handful. In some
countreys they begyn to sowe pees soone after Christmasse:
and in some places they sowe bothe pees and <span class="linenum">32</span>

is good season, so that they be sowen ere the

dounged, and lyenge rygged all the depe and colde of

<div class="sidenote">[Fol. 11.]</div>

drye, and the dongynge maketh it to be melowe and <span class="linenum">4</span>
ranke. And if a drye season come before Candelmasse,
or sone after, it wolde be caste downe and waterforowed
bytwene the landes, that the wete rest not in the raine:

and to sowe in euery acre fyue London bushelles, or

that there cometh no seasonable wether before Marche,
to plowe his barley-erthe. And as soone as he hath <span class="linenum">12</span>
sowen his pees and beanes, than let hym caste his barley-erthe,
and shortly after rygge it agayne: soo that it be

than sowe it vpon the castynge. <span class="linenum">16</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
¶ It is to be knowen that there be thre maner of barleys,
that is to say, sprot-barleye, longe-eare, and beare-barley,
<div class="sidenote">Sprot-barley.</div>

that some menne call bigge. Sprot-barley hath a flat
eare most comonly, thre quarters of an inche brode, <span class="linenum">20</span>
and thre inches long, and the cornes be very great
<div class="sidenote">Long-ear.</div>

and white, and it is the best barley. Long-eare hath
a flatte eare, halfe an inche brode, and foure inches
and more of length: but the corne is not so greate <span class="linenum">24</span>
nor soo whyte, and sooner it wyll turne and growe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in Marche is tyme to sowe otes, and specially vpon

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
And it is to be knowen, that there be .iii. maner of otes,
<div class="sidenote">Red oats.</div>

that is to saye, redde otes, blacke otes, and roughe otes.
Red otes are the beste otes, and whan they be thresshed, <span class="linenum">8</span>
they be yelowe in the busshell, and verye good to make
<div class="sidenote">Black oats.</div>

haue not so moche floure in them, for they haue a thycker

<div class="sidenote">Rough oats.</div>

The roughe otes be the worste, and it quiteth not the

It is a greate labour and payne to the oxen, to goo to
<div class="sidenote">‘The ox is
never woe,
Till he to the

harowe: for they were better to goo to the plowe two
dayes, thanne to harowe one daye. It is an olde saying,
‘The oxe is neuer wo, tyll he to the harowe goo.’ And <span class="linenum">20</span>
it is bycause it goeth by twytches, and not alwaye
<div class="sidenote">[Fol. 13.]</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And as they weare, or breake, they dryue them downe

<h3>16. ¶ To falowe.</h3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nowe these housbandes haue sowen theyr pees, beanes,

<div class="sidenote">Never fallow

else</div>

wedes, and tourneth the roote vpwarde, that it maye not

rayne that commeth, shal washe the lande, and dryue <span class="linenum">20</span>
awaye the dounge and the good moulde, that the lande

shall be moche the worse. An other cause is, the rayne
shall beate the lande so flat, and bake it so hard to-gyther,
that if a drye Maye come, it wyll be to harde to stere in <span class="linenum">24</span>
<div class="sidenote">(3) the weeds

the moneth of June. And the thyrde cause is, the wiedes
shall take suche roote, er sterynge-tyme comme, that they
wylle not be cleane tourned vndernethe, the whiche shal
be great hurte to the corne, whan it shall be sowen, and <span class="linenum">28</span>

One is, if it be layde vpon his fallowe, all that fallethe

it is rygged agayne, it lyeth soo depe in the erthe, that <span class="linenum">12</span>

<h3>21. ¶ Howe to wede corne.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">How to

&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nowe it wolde be knowen, howe these cornes shulde be
weded. The chyefe instrument to wede with is a paire
of tonges made of wode, and in the farther ende it is
nycked, to holde the wed faster; and after a shoure of <span class="linenum">4</span>
raine it is beste wedynge, for than they maye be pulled
vp by the rotes, and than it cometh neuer agayne. And
<div class="sidenote">Weeding-hook.</div>

if it be drye wether, than muste ye haue a wedynge-hoke
with a socket set vpon a lyttel staffe of a yarde longe, and <span class="linenum">8</span>
this hoke wolde be well steeled, and grounde sharpe bothe
<div class="sidenote">Forked stick.</div>

behynde and before. And in his other hande he hath a
forked stycke a yarde longe, and with his forked stycke
<div class="sidenote">[Fol. 18.]</div>

he putteth the wede from hym, and he putteth the hoke <span class="linenum">12</span>
beyond the rote of the wede, and pulleth it to hym, and
cutteth the wede fast by the erthe, and with his hoke he
taketh up the wede, and casteth it in the reane, and if
the reane be full of corne, it is better it stande styll, <span class="linenum">16</span>
whan it is cut, and wyddre: but let hym beware, that he
trede not to moche vppon the corne, and specyallye after
<div class="sidenote">Cut not the
corn.</div>

it is shotte, and whan he cutteth the wede, that he cut
not the corne: and therefore the hoke wolde not passe <span class="linenum">20</span>
an inche wyde. And whanne the wede is soo shorte,
that he can not with his forked stycke put it from hym,
and with the hoke pull it to hym, thanne muste he set
his hoke vppon the wede, fast by the erthe, and put it <span class="linenum">24</span>
from hym, and so shall he cutte it cleane. And with
<div class="sidenote">Stoop not.</div>

these two instruments, he shall neuer stoupe to his warke.
Dogfenell, goldes, mathes, and kedlokes are yll to wede

harder and dryer it is, and the worse for al maner of

An other dysease is called rysen vppon, and no man

<div class="sidenote">The beast’s

There is a blyster rysen vnder the tounge, the whiche

&nbsp;&nbsp;
There be beastes that wyll turne about, whan they

must be taken out, or els he shal neuer mende, but dye
at lengthe, and this is the remedy and the greatest cure
that can be on a beaste. Take that beast, and cast him <span class="linenum">8</span>
downe, and bynde his foure fete together, and with thy

But they maye not beare sackes, nor be rydden vppon

to the housbande. For she wyll labour and beare whan <span class="linenum">12</span>

well as the horse. It is conuenient for the husbande to
knowe, whanne his mare wolde be horsed. It is the
<div class="sidenote">[Fol. 40<em>b</em>.]</div>

common sayenge, that she wyll take the hors within .ix. or <span class="linenum">16</span>

For she wyl not holde to it, excepte she be kene of horsyng,

brynge her to a hors, and let her be with hym a day or a <span class="linenum">24</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>

that some one horse wyll gette more horse-fooles than <span class="linenum">56</span>
other horse wyll doo, and lyke wyse a mare wyll beare moo
mare-fooles than some other mare wyll do, thoughe they
be horsed bothe with one horse. Me semeth there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>

But and ye haue mares of dyuers colours, than do as

haue no white vpon them, a coloured horse that hath <span class="linenum">68</span>

As sayncte Iherome saythe, there is greate difference or
<div class="sidenote">Difference

diuersitie betwene preachinge and doctrine. A preachyng

behouable, if it seme expedient to hym, for that is an

<h3>172. ¶ What is the greattest offence that a manne may doo

In myne opynyon, it is to be in despayre of the mercye
of god. And therefore what soo euer thou haue doone

<p>These Notes are principally concerned with the numerous variations exhibited

<p><b>Prologue</b>; lines 2, 6. See Job, v. 7; 2 Thess. iii. 10.</p>

<p>15. The allusion is to Caxton’s Book of the Chess; see the description of it
in Ames’ Typographical Antiquities, ed. Dibdin, i. 36, where woodcuts will be
found representing the several pieces.</p>

<p>20. <em>iudges.</em> Caxton calls them <em>rooks</em>, as at present, but he describes them as
being vicars and legates of the king, i.e. as occupying the position of judges.</p>

<p><em>yomenne</em>, pawns. In Caxton, we find the division of pawns into eight classes
(answering to the eight pawns on each side), in which the king’s rook’s pawn
represents the <em>husbandman</em>. The next in order, the king’s knight’s pawn, is the
<em>smith</em>; after which, in due order, we find the <em>notary</em>, <em>merchant</em>, <em>physician</em>, <em>taverner</em>,
<em>guard</em> (or watchman), and the <em>ribald</em> or dice-player, whose character is not well
spoken of. This eight-fold division seems to me to have suggested the well-known
formula which divides men into the eight classes of ‘soldier, sailor, tinker,
tailor, gentleman, apothecary, ploughboy, thief;’ which is sometimes otherwise
varied. The German formula is. ‘Edelmann, Bettelman, Amtmann, Pastor,
Kaufmann, Laufmann, Maler, Major;’ also, be it observed, eight-fold. Our
soldier, tinker, tailor, apothecary, ploughboy, and thief, may be imagined to
correspond, with sufficient exactitude, to Caxton’s guard, smith, merchant,
physician, husbandman, and ribald.</p>

<p>27. <em>Remytte</em>, leave. A word is evidently omitted; we must supply <em>to</em> after <em>as</em>,
or else substitute <em>to</em> for <em>as</em>. In the Book of Surveying, ch. ix, we find, “I remytte
that to menne of lawe;” and again, in ch. xii, “I remytte all those poyntes to
menne of lawe.” See also <a href="#S_7">sect. 7</a>, l. 14.</p>

  <div><a name="N_1" id="N_1"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>1.</b></span> 1. For the manner in which I. R. rewrites this section, see the <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Preface</a>.</p>

  <div><a name="N_2" id="N_2"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>2.</b></span> 5. <em>Chylturne.</em> As to the sense, we find, in the Book of Surveying, c. 37,
the following. “Chylturne grounde and flyntye grounde be light groundes and
drye, and full of small stones, and chalke grounde is moche of the same nature,
and they wyll weare and washe awaye with water.”</p>

<p>6. <em>Meane erthe</em>, earth of ordinary character. <em>Mean</em> is moderate, ordinary.
I. R. alters it to ‘<em>maine</em> earth,’ which was probably not intended. After <em>marle</em>,
he inserts&mdash;“some neither Sand nor Clay, but like a mixture of both, yet neither,
which is called a Hassell ground.”</p>

<p>9. I. R. has&mdash;“In Sommerset-shiere, Dawset-shiere, and Gloster-shiere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Zelcester.</em> The old character Ʒ, which had the force of <em>y</em> at the beginning of a
word,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> was often printed as Z, by confusion. Bishop Percy used to print such
ludicrous forms as <em>zow</em>, <em>zour</em>, instead of <em>yow</em>, <em>your</em>. I conclude that <em>Zelcester</em> =
<em>Yelcester</em>, <em>i.e.</em> Ilchester. The form occurs again in sect. 27, l. 17.</p>

<p>16. <em>many other places.</em> J. R. says&mdash;“in some parte of Hartford-shiere, Sussex,
and Cornwall.”</p>

<p>24. <em>aslope</em>] I. R. has <em>a flote</em>, <em>gyue out</em>, i.e. spread out, are too obtuse.</p>

<p>26. I. R. says&mdash;“In Cambridge-shiere, Huntington-shiere, Bedford-shiere,
and for the most part of Northamton-shiere, theyr Ploughes haue but one hale.
In Leister-shiere, Lankishiere, Yorkshiere, Lincolnshiere, and Notingham-shiere,
they haue two; for all other Countries [<em>counties</em>] vnnamed, there is none of them
but plow with some of these Ploughes before-mentioned.”</p>

  <div><a name="N_3" id="N_3"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>3.</b></span> 1. The parts of a plough are enumerated in Gervase Markham’s Complete
Husbandman (1614), which is quoted at length in Rogers’s Hist. of Agriculture
and Prices, vol. i. p. 534. It is probable that the plough, as described by
Fitzherbert, did not materially differ from that in use in 1614.</p>

<p>The principal parts, according to Markham, are as follows.</p>

<p>(1). ‘The <em>ploughbeam</em>, a large and long piece of timber, which forms an arch
for the other parts of the plough.’ It is, says Fitzherbert, the long beam above,
which is slightly bent. The plough-sheath, the coulter, and the plough-foot, are
all mortised into it, pointing downwards.</p>

<p>(2). ‘The <em>skeath</em> (i.e. <em>sheath</em>), a piece of wood two and a half feet long, eight
inches broad, and two inches thick, which is mortised into the beam, and sloping
forwards below it.’ Fitzherbert says it is a thin piece of dry oak, fixed both in
the plough-beam and the share-beam, and is the chief ‘band,’ i.e. strengthening
piece or support, of the whole plough. By ‘thin,’ he must mean that it is thin
(2 inches) in proportion to its breadth (8 inches); it is necessary that it should
be very strong, as it holds the implement together.</p>

<p>(3). ‘The plough’s <em>principal hale</em> on the left hand, a long bent piece of wood,
somewhat strong in the midst, and so slender at the upper end that a man may
easily gripe it.’ This is Fitzherbert’s <em>plough-tail</em> (l. 16), which he says is mortised
into the sharebeam behind, and pinned to the ploughbeam behind also. The
ploughman holds it in his <em>left</em> hand. It is also called the <em>ploughstart</em>; where <em>start</em>
means <em>tail</em>, as in <em>red-start</em>.</p>

<p>(4). ‘The <em>plough-head</em>, which is fixed with the skeath and the hale, all at one
instant, into two several mortise-holes; a flat piece of timber, about three feet in
length, seven inches in breadth, and two and a half in thickness, and having two
nicks towards the head of the plough.’ This is the same as what Fitzherbert calls
the <em>sharebeam</em>; see the explanation in <a href="#S_2">sect. 2</a>, l. 10.</p>

<p>(5). ‘The <em>plough-spindles</em>, two round pieces of wood which couple the hales
[handles] together.’ These are what Fitzherbert calls the <em>rough staves</em>; see <a href="#S_3">l. 35</a>.</p>

<p>(6). ‘The <em>right-hand hale</em>, through which the other end of the spindles run,
much more slender than the left-hand hale, because no force is put on it.’ This
is Fitzherbert’s <em>plough-stilt</em>; see <a href="#S_3">l. 21</a>.</p>

<p>(7). The <em>plough-rest</em>, a small piece of wood, fixed at one end in the further nick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of the plough-head, and on the other end to the right-hand hale.’ ‘In the Middle
Ages,’ says Prof. Rogers, ‘it appears that this part was made of iron, and that it
was occasionally double.’ We must remember that <em>plough-head</em> means the <em>sharebeam</em>.</p>

<p>(8). ‘The <em>shelboard</em> [i.e. shield-board], a board of more than an inch thick,
covering the right side of the plough, and fastened with two strong wooden pins
to the skeath and right-hand hale.’</p>

<p>(9). ‘The <em>coulter</em>, a long piece of iron made sharp at one end, passing on one
side by a mortise-hole through the beam, and held in place by an iron ring which
winds round the beam and strengthens it.’ Fitzherbert’s description is slightly
different; see <a href="#S_3">l. 48</a>. The use of the coulter is to make the first incision into the
earth; it precedes the share, which follows it and completes its work.</p>

<p>(10). ‘The <em>share</em>. If this be needed for a mixed earth, it is made without a
wing, or with a small one only: if, however, it be needed for a deep or stiff
clay, it should be made with a large wing or an outer point.’</p>

<p>(11). ‘The <em>plough-foot</em>. This is an iron implement, passed through a mortise-hole,
and fastened at the farther end of the beam by a wedge or two, so that the
husbandman may at his discretion set it higher or lower; the use being to give
the plough earth or to put it from the earth, for the more it is driven downward
the more it raises the beam from the ground and makes the irons forsake the earth,
and the more it is driven upward, the more it lets down the beam and makes the
irons bite the ground.’ Fitzherbert well describes it as ‘a stay to order of what
deepness the plough shall go.’ The word <em>ploughfote</em> occurs in Piers Plowman,
B. vi. 105; see my notes to that poem, vol. iv. p. 161. This part of the plough
was also called a <em>plough-shoe</em> (in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferripedalis</i>); see Rogers (as above),
p. 538. In a modern plough, the plough-foot is generally replaced by small
wheels. I may remark that it was placed in front, before the coulter.</p>

<p>If we compare the preceding account with that given by Fitzherbert, we shall
see that the two nearly agree. Fitzherbert’s <em>plough-beam</em>, <em>plough-sheath</em>, and
<em>plough-tail</em> are Nos. 1, 2, and 3 above; his <em>stilt</em>, <em>rest</em>, and <em>shieldboard</em> are Nos.
6, 7, and 8; his <em>rough staves</em>, <em>plough-foot</em>, <em>share</em>, and <em>coulter</em>, are Nos. 5, 11, 10,
and 9. But he has three additional terms, viz. the <em>sharebeam</em>, which is the
wooden frame for the <em>share</em>, and is called by Markham the <em>plough-head</em> (No. 4).
Secondly, the <em>fen-board</em>, i.e. <em>mud-board</em>, covering the <em>left</em> side of the plough, and
fastened to the <em>left</em> of the sheath and the <em>left</em> hale, much as the shield-board is
fastened to the <em>right</em> of the sheath and the <em>right</em> hale. Lastly, the <em>plough-ear</em>,
defined as ‘three pieces of iron, nailed fast to the right side of the plough-beam,’
for which poor men substituted ‘a crooked piece of wood pinned fast
to the plough-beam.’ What was the use of this appendage we are not expressly
told; but it seems to have been used for fastening the trace to, for draught;
see <a href="#S_4"><span class="fs120"><b>4.</b></span></a> 34.</p>

<p>Fitzherbert also notices the <em>plough-mal</em>, i.e. plough-mall or plough-mallet
(l. 55), which seems to have consisted of a head of hard wood and a ‘pynne,’ or
handle, and to have been loosely stuck into the plough-beam by passing the
handle through ‘an augurs bore,’ i.e. through a hole bored in the beam by an
augur for this especial purpose. This was no real <em>part</em> of the plough, but only
a tool conveniently kept at hand. He does not, however, mention the plough-staff
(or akerstaff), which was ‘a pole shod with a flat iron, the purpose of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
was to clear the mould-board from any stiff earth which might cling to it while
the plough was at work’; Rogers, as above, p. 539. This was originally held
in the right hand (see my notes to P. Plowman); but I think it likely that,
when a second handle, or <em>stilt</em>, came into use, the plough-staff was given up.
Wright’s Prov. Glossary gives “<em>mell</em>, <em>mellet</em>, a square piece of wood fitted with
a handle, a mallet.”</p>

<p>10. I. R. says of the <em>sharbeame</em>, that “in some Countries it is called the
plough-head.” Fitzherbert has already said this, see <a href="#S_2"><span class="fs120"><b>2.</b></span></a> 10.</p>

<p class="p1 center bold">Chapter 8. ¶ How a man should plough all manner of Lands all times of the
yeare.</p>

<p>Now that I haue prescribed the manner to make and temper the most or all the
sorts of Ploughs, it shall next seeme expedient for me to show the manner and
time of the yeare in which a man ought to Plough, and for the better vnderstanding
of the ignorant, I will begin at the beginning of the yeare, and so succeede
downe-ward: After the feast of <em>Epiphanie</em> it is time for a Husbandman to
goe to Plough, to wit, if your ground be a stiffe and a tough clay, then shall you
begin and Plough your Pease-earth, which is, where you had your Wheate, Rye,
and Barley, the yeere before: this ground being ploughed, you shall let it so lye,
which is called bayting some fiue or sixe dayes, that it may receaue a frost or two,
which frost will so lighten and deuide the earth, that when you shall come to
harrow it, it will runne to a very good mold, that otherwise it would neuer doe.
If your ground be naturally light and sandy, then may you immediatly vpon your
ploughing sowe without giuing your ground any bayte at all. When your Pease
earth is sowne, and the Spring is creeping on: then if you will follow <em>Virgils</em>
famous principles, begin to fallow your ground which must rest that yeare. In
the beginning of Lent sow your Barley upon clay grounds, but in hote sandy
grounds, if you stay a moneth or more longer it will be much the better. At
mid-sommer stirre vp a-new, that is, Plow againe your fallow ground: &amp; before
the rising of the North-starre, which is eleuen dayes before the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æquinoctial
Autumnal</i>, or the thirteenth of September, then sow your Wheate and Rye, and
these be the seasons and the graynes to sow, except Oates, which is alwayes to be
vsed in like manner as Barley is. If you haue any ley ground to fallow or breake
vp for to sowe Oates vpon, then let that be the first thing you take in hand, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the grasse and the mosse may be rot in it, and let your Plough runne a deepe
square furrow, and in all manner of ploughing, see that your eye, your hand, and
your foote agree, and be alwaies ready one to serue another, and to turne vp so
much mold and to lay it flatte that it reare not an edge: for if it stand vp vpon
an edge, the grasse and mosse can neuer kindly rotte, which being vsed as it
should, is an excellent manuring.</p>

<p>If you sowe Winter-corne, as eyther Wheate or Rye vpon swarth ground, looke
how much Corne toucheth the mosse, so much will be drowned and cannot spring,
the mosse in his owne nature dooth keepe so much wette in it selfe. In some
Countries, if a man plow deepe, hee shal plough past the good ground, and so haue
little Corne, but that Country in my iudgement is not fitte for tyllage, but rather
thereto to reare and breede Cattell, as Oxen, Kine, or Sheepe, or els they must
goe beate their lands with Mattocks, as they doo in many places of Cornwall, and
in some places of Deuonshiere. The manner of plowing land is in three formes:
eyther they be great Lands, as with high ridges and deepe furrowes, as in all the
North parts of this Land, and in some sotherne parts also, or els flatte and plaine,
without ridge or furrow, as in most parts of Cambridge-shiere: or els in little
Lands, no Land containing aboue two or three furrowes, as in Midlesex, Essex,
and Hartfordshiere.</p>

<p>For the first, it is needfull, where the grounde is stife, tough, and binding,
beeing alwaies capable of much wette, that if the Lands did not lie hie, not onely
would the fatnesse choake the Corne ere it could come foorth, but also the colde
soaking wette, would confound the vigor and strengthe of the seede. For the
second, that is good where the ground is somewhat light, and giuen to barrennesse:
so that what forcst [<em>read</em> forct] vertue soeuer you thrust into the ground, either by
manure or otherwise, the Land lying flatte and plaine, shall still retaine it, not
suffering it as els it would to wash away with euery shower. For the last, that
is, where the grounde is both barren, cold, and stiffe: if there you plough in
large Lands, the wether and season will so binde it together, that the seede shall
burst, but not finde any passage to sproute. Againe, such ground is subiect to
much weede, besides, if your lands should be any greater, you should neuer
possibly come to weede them, eyther as they would or they should be done.</p>

  <div><a name="N_9" id="N_9"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>9.</b></span> I. R. alters this section, noting&mdash;“Neuer sowe Pease or Beanes on a light,
hote sand ground, for that will neuer beare them, but for the Beane, the extreamest
and the stiffest ground is the best. If it bee lesse stiffe, then the mingled
ware<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> is best, as Pease and Beanes well sorted. If it bee neither stiffe nor light,
then cleane Pease is the best, for they wil prosper most kindliest.”</p>

<p>13. I. R. adds&mdash;“Pease are an excellent seede, and inrich ground as much as
the light manuring: which is the reason, that in many places of Lincoln-shiere,
and els where, sowing their inam Wheate where theyr Pease grew, they haue the
finest Corne.”</p>

for if they doo, the goodnesse of your manure, chiefely if it take a shower of raine,
will runne into the ground where the heape stands, and the rest when it is spread
will little profit.”</p>

<p>29&ndash;35. I. R. makes a new section of this, headed “Chapter 20. Of the diuers
kindes of Manure, and which is the best.” It is as follows.</p>

<p>There be diuers sorts of Manures, and first of those that bee worst, as Swines
dunge, which Manure breedeth and bringeth vp thistles; the scourings of Hay-barnes
or Corne barnes, which bringeth vp sundry weedes and quirks [quicks?];<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and rotten Chaffe, which diuers vse, but brings little good. The shoueling of
highwayes and streetes is very good, chiefely for Barley. Horse-dunge is reasonable.
The dunge of all maner of Cattel that chew the cudde is most excellent. Doues
dunge for colde ground is best of all, but it must be spred very thinne. For
grounds that are giuen to riue and chap, ashes is excellent, for they will binde
and knit together. Also for such grounds it is most singular to burne the stubble
on the ground, which is worth tenne manurings: for it fatneth (saith <em>Virgill</em>)
the soyle, and yeeldeth a secrete force of nourishment vnto the seede. Also,
euery euill is tryed out by the fire, and the vnprofitable moisture is forced to
sweat out, it giueth a vent and passage for the iuyce that quickeneth the Corne,
and it closeth the gaping vaines and holes of the earth, through which, eyther
extreame moysture, extreame heate, or wind, would blast the Corne. Also in
Cheshiere, Lankishiere, and other Countreys, they vse for manure a kinde of
blewe Marble-like earth, which they call Marle. This is for those Countries an
excellent manure, and though it be exceeding chargeable, yet through good
neighbour-hood it quiteth the cost: for if you manure your groundes once in
seauen or twelue yeares, it is sufficient, and look how many yeares he beareth
Corne, so many yeares he will beare grasse, and that plenty. Straw layd to rot
in the Winter, is good dung.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is another Wheat, which is called hole-straw Wheat; it hath
the largest eare of al Wheats, the boldest Corne, and yeeldeth the most, the finest,
though not the whitest floure; it is foure-square, and hath short anns; the straw
is not hollow, but hath a strong pith throughout, by reason wherof in his growth
no weather whatsoeuer can beare him downe, but still he will stand and prosper;
his straw yeeldeth as good thatch as Reeds, a singular profit for a Husbandman:
and it is an excellent fewell to bake or brew with, euen as good as Gorsse or
Whins: Onely Cattell will not eate it, nor is it good for litter; this of all Wheats
is the best: these last named are to be sowne on the fallow ground, and the better
the ground is, the better they will prosper.</p>

<p>When you sowe your Rye choose a dry season, for small wet killeth Rye. Rie,
as the old husbands say, will drowne in the Hopper, that is, if in the Hopper hee
catch a shower, his vigor is slaine. Wherfore the drier his mold, is the better,
which is the cause that the hote, dry, and light sand is onely for Rye most
excellent: his mold must harrow small like a Garden-bed, for the smallest clot
hindereth his comming vp; his sprout is so small and tender.</p>

¶ How to make barraine ground bring foorth good Corne.</p>

<p>If thy ground be barraine and hard, yeelding nothing but ill Hay of insuing
profit, then shal it be necessary for thee to vse these secrets in Art which is most
auaileable. And first for thy Pease, Beanes, Barley, and Oates, if thou sowest
any of them: sowe them vpon the eight day of April, which is the Equinoctiall

be assured that no Corne thou sowest shall faile, then take Salt-peeter and mingle
with thy Corne, and sow it, and thy labor shall neuer be frustrate. For want of
it, take the black dreggs of Oyle, and wette thy seede ere thou sow it, and it shall
vndoubtedly spring vp. If thou hast none of these, then take Pigions dunge,
and mingle it with thy seede in thy hopper, and sow it: though it be not so good
as the other, yet is the profitable vertue wonderfull.</p>

<p>12. I. R. adds&mdash;For your seede, if you will be aduised by me, you shall change
it alway once in two or three yeare. For to sow continually one seede bred in
one soyle it will decay &amp; grow ill: and in your exchange draw it alwayes from

Staples: some long and hairie, as those bredde in barren cold Countries, and that
is the worst; some hard, short, and curld, as those bred in woody grounds, and that
is better: some long, thicke, soft, and curled, and that is the best of all: and they
be bredde vpon fine heathes, where they haue short, dry, and sweet foode. The
profit of wooll the world can witnesse, and yeerely your Ewes will bring forth
Lambes, which is an other commoditie; and lastly, in some Countries, as in
Suffolke, Essex, and Kent, with many other, they milke their Ewes, a gaine
equall to the rest. Therfore when you chuse sheepe, elect them big-boand and
well-woolld, their colours beeing white. For <em>Virgill</em> faines, that <em>Cynthia</em>, the
Goddess of Chastitie, in whose thoughts could neuer enter impuritie, was
enamored of <em>Endimion</em> onely through hys flocke of white sheepe. When therfore
you haue got a flock of white sheepe, then you must chuse Rams to equall them,
for preseruing the breede: your Ram would bee white also, and ouer and beside
you must looke in his mouth, and if the roofe thereof be blacke, then is hee
not good: for either hee will then get blacke Lambes, or at least staine theyr
fleeces with a duskie colour. The greater the homes of your Ram is, the
worse; for the pollard is the chiefest Ram.</p>

Winter as well as with grasse in Sommer. Also in the Winter such Sheepe as
thou intendest to fatte and sell, let them either haue straw or fleakes to lie vpon,

<p>6, 7. The sense is&mdash;and if she (the ewe) will not stand sideways beside the lamb;
<em>i.e.</em> in such a position that the lamb can approach her side. There is an evident

the grammar of the text; for Fitzherbert does not say “<em>and</em> give her,” but
“<em>than</em> gyue her,” <em>i.e.</em> then give her. Consequently all that precedes the word

<p class="p1 center bold">Chapter 20.<br />

¶ Of Goates and their profit or vse.</p>

<p>Thus hauing sufficiently debated touching the choosing, cherishing, and curing
of sheep, I thinke it good a little to speake of Goates and their vse: a kinde of
Cattell which albe heere in England we estimate not to his worth, yet in other
places they be of highest valuation: and the excellent poet <em>Virgill</em> in his
Countrey muse, draweth them and sheepe to march in one euen equipage. Thus
comparing them, the Goate (saith he) yeeldeth in milke three times the quantity a
sheepe doth, theyr young ones are more plentifull, for they will haue two or three,
and sometimes more, and their beards yearely being shorne and spunne, haue made
an excellent during stuffe, which for the continuance, hath made Marriners desirous
onely to weare it in their garments, so that though their beards cannot in quantity
and fineness be equall with the fleece of the sheepe, yet ioyning their milke and
their young ones to their beards, there is no wonderfull difference.</p>

<p>Their manner of keeping, both wintering and sommering, is in the Poets rules
the same that the Sheepe hath, onely theyr foulding and feed excepted: for the
foulding they are not needfull, and for their feede, Woods are the best, or the
toppes of Mountaines: bushie and thorny grounds vnprofitable for any other vse,
for the feede of Goates is most excellent. They will obserue custome much better
than Sheepe, for beeing but once or twice vsed there-vnto, they will duely euery
morning and euening come home, to pay theyr due debt or tribute to the milke-paile.
Theyr milk is excellent, and a great restoratiue, principally for a consumption,
of what nature soeuer. The fourth howre after the Sun rise, is the best time
for Goates to drinke in. For the weaning of young Kidds from their Dams, vse
the meanes that you doo with Ewes and Lambes.</p>

<p>Of all Goates that are, <em>Virgil</em> most commends the <em>Cinyphian</em> Goates, bred by
the Towne <em>Cinyps</em>, as Cattell of wondrous great co<em>m</em>moditie: their disprofit is
onely amongst young springs or plants, for they wil crop any young thing that
groweth, and hinder the springing thereof, also they wil pill away the barke of
Trees, to the spoyle of the trees: yet no more then fallow Deare, or redde Deare
will, wherfore where the one is suffered, the other may be tollerated. Cf. Virg.

<p class="p1 center bold">Chapter 31.</p>

<p class="bold">¶ A soueraigne vnguent to cure the scabbe, itch, botches, or any surfeite
whatsoeuer that commeth of heat or pouerty: or by mischance: taken from a

mingle these together, and incorporate them in manner of a plaister. The
<em>Macedonians</em> and <em>Gelonians</em> to this receit adde the opening of a vaine in the sole
of the foote of a beast, and then to giue him to drinke milke and horses blood
mingled together, which cureth all inward impostumes, surfeits or poysons, and to
the outward griefe to apply the plaister, which was neuer knowne to be frustrate.</p>

  <div><a name="N_68" id="N_68"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>68.</b></span> Here I. R. introduces a long flourish about the nobleness of horses,
instancing the fabulous brood born to Neptune and Ceres (who transformed herself
into a mare), the transformation of Saturn into a horse, and the like.</p>

<p>22. I. R. has&mdash;and that shall yee knowe by diuers signes, as by her riding of

<p>63&ndash;79. I. R. varies this, and has&mdash;put to your white Mares a daple-gray
Horse, so shall he gette all daples; to your bright bay mares a blacke bay horse,
and so shall you gette all broune bayes; and to your blacke Mares, a blacke
Horse, so he haue white feet, white ratch, and white feather; so shall he gette
well-marked blacke Colts. But for the Carte it much matters not for colours, but
for knowledge sake know that th<em>e</em> broune bay, the daple-gray, the bright bay, and
the white lyard, are the best colours; all other colours haue defects and are
imperfect: of markes one white foote, a white starre, a white snyp, or a white
rache is good: and an Ostrige feather in any place where the horse cannot see it,
is the best of all the markes that can be for a horse. And thus much for horses
or mares to be chosen or vsed.</p>

Horse trots so narrow that he hewes [knocks] one legge vpon another.’ It is what

<p>18. <em>a greatte</em>] by great. The two phrases have different senses; <em>a greate</em> means
‘in the lump,’ without cutting or dressing the trees, as appears from the next line.

<p>After this section I. R. inserts ‘Chapter 17. Howe to graft by leafe, causing
all manner of fruit to grow vpon one tree.’ His method is to insert what we

<p>With this Chapter he closes ‘the third booke of Husbandry.’</p>

<p>The fourth book has an introductory chapter, not in Fitzherbert, subdivided
into sections with the following headings. The office of a Steward of a houshold.
For prouiding of victuals. The Steward and Garniter.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The Steward and Miller.

Of the Cooke. Of the Scullery. Of the Vsher of the Hall. Of the Yeoman of
the Wardrop [Wardrobe]. The Slaughter-man. The Cater [caterer]. The
Clarke of the Kitchin.</p>

<p>After this, I. R. condescends to return to his original.</p>

  <div><a name="N_141" id="N_141"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>141.</b></span> 36. <em>sherde</em>] breach (which is a gloss).</p>

<p>49. <em>tyne</em>] shut (a gloss). <em>traile</em>] tale (probably a misprint).</p>

<p>59. <em>put it</em>] blot them.</p>

<p>72. <em>loked uppon</em>] attended vnto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

  <div><a name="N_142" id="N_142"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>142.</b></span> This is a most singular section, since it presupposes that a gentleman’s
servant would be able to recognise the rhythm of an English hexameter. As an
early experiment in hexameters, it is very curious. In the original, it is printed
as <em>prose</em>, but each line ends with a full stop, and the next begins with a capital
letter. I have therefore printed it as verse. It is, however, of a rather rude
character; <em>horne boget</em> hardly comes up to our idea of a dactyl, nor <em>and shoes</em> to
that of a spondee. For the reader’s assistance, I may remark that the <em>dactyls</em> are
as follows: <em>Purse dagger, -chef shoyng-, horne boget, -ter sadel-, hatte with thy,
Bowe arrowes, stringe and thy, Penne paper, -waxe pommes, bokes thou re-, -ble
nedle, leste that thy, -gel gyue thy, se he be, Make mery, synge and thou, hede to thy,
gere that thou</em>. The rest are spondees.</p>

<p>I. R., not perceiving the law of rhythm, makes wild work of it. He calls it
“An excellent rude Lesson in rude ryme.” He divides the lines rightly, and
leaves the first three verses untouched. But the rest assume the following fearful
forms.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Penne, paper, incke, parchment, redde waxe, punisse (<em>sic</em>),</p>
<p class="verse2">and bookes doe thou remember,</p>
<p class="verse0">Penknife, combe, thymble, needle, thred, and poynt,</p>
<p class="verse2">least that by chaunce thy garth breake.</p>
<p class="verse0">Bodkin, knyfe, rubber, giue thy horse meate,</p>
<p class="verse2">See he be shodde well, make merry, sing if thou can,</p>
<p class="verse2">And take heede to thy needments, that thou loose none.</p>
</div></div>

<p>I think we may fairly put these down as being the worst verses extant in the
English language; though this is saying a good deal.</p>

  <div><a name="N_143" id="N_143"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>143.</b></span> 7. The saying doubtless represents a rude couplet in verse. The dative
case <em>wyfe</em> (governed by <em>of</em>) was formerly spelt <em>wyue</em>, and rimed with <em>thryue</em>.</p>

  <div><a name="N_144" id="N_144"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>144.</b></span> <em>Salomon</em>, Solomon. But where to find, in his writings, this remarkable
sentence, I do not know.</p>

<p><img class="hand" src="images/stars.jpg" width="20" alt="" /> After this section I. R. inserts a quantity of additional matter, which he
tells us (at p. 174) is drawn from his ‘owne experience in byrds and foules.’
The additional chapters treat of choice of cocks, hens for brood, number of
eggs to each hen, chickens, diseases of poultry (especially of the pip), choice
of poultry, how to fat poultry, how to make capons, where to keep poultry,
how to choose, keep, and fatten geese, how to keep ducks, peacocks, ‘ginny or
turkie-cocks,’ pigeons, pheasants, turtles, partridges, and swans; after which
digression he returns to his text. I may remark that he considers it essential
that a hen should sit upon <em>an odd number</em> of eggs, say 19, and that matters
should be so arranged as to provide for the hatching of chickens ‘in the
increase of the Moone.’ The leaves of a bay-tree, ‘or els some Bents or
Grasse,’ will preserve eggs ‘from the hurt of thunder.’ Chickens ought not ‘to
be breathed vpon by any Snake, Toade, or other venomous thing’; if they are,
you must quickly burn amongst them some ‘<em>Galbanum</em>, or womans hayre.’
Those that have the pip should be dieted on Hearbgrace [rue] or garlic. Geese
‘are more watchfull then Doggs.’ ‘You must vse in the time of brooding, to lay
vnder your egges [of geese] the rootes of Nettles, to the end the Gosling may
escape stinging of Nettles, which otherwise many times killeth them.’ If geese
are to have fat livers, feed them on dry figs mingled with water. Ducks chiefly
delight in acorns. If you praise a peacock, ‘he will presently sette vp his taile.’
A turkey-cock ‘is very highly esteemed of, both for his rarenesse and greatnes of
body;’ and we are told that he changes the colour of the wrinkled skin about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
head at pleasure, either to white, red, blue, yellow, ‘or what other colour els hee
list; which thing maketh him seeme wonderfull st[r]ange to them that behold it.’ ... ‘Their
greatest diseases is the Pip and the Squecke.’ As to pigeons, ‘I haue
knowne some that haue builded their Doue-houses vpon high pillars ouer the
midst of some Pond or great water, both because they delight much in water, and
also to keepe them the safer from vermine.’ Swans ‘will, when they waxe olde,
declare the time of their own death to be neere approching, by a sweete and
lamentable note which they then sing.’</p>

  <div><a name="N_145" id="N_145"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>145.</b></span> 15. I. R. has&mdash;‘Wherefore it is conuenient (I say) that they loue each
other as effectually as loue can in the best sence comprehend: and this worke
especiallie, a woman is bound both by law and nature to performe.’ Why so?</p>

  <div><a name="N_146" id="N_146"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>146.</b></span> I. R. omits ll. 2&ndash;7; he was certainly a Protestant.</p>

<p>8. <em>redy.</em> This is the old word for <em>dressed</em>, as might be shewn by many examples.
It may suffice to say that I. R. explains <em>araye theym</em> in l. 11 by <em>make them
ready</em>.</p>

<p>10. <em>socle</em>] suckle. I. R. omits <em>sye vp thy mylke</em>, which he probably did not
understand.</p>

<p>13. I. R. omits <em>and take thy parte with theym</em>; and, for <em>serue thy swyne</em> (l. 20)
he puts <em>looke to the seruing of thy Swine</em>. Customs were probably changing.</p>

<p>31. <em>the gleyd</em>] Kites. And <em>fullymartes</em> is omitted.</p>

<p>35. After <em>eate</em>, I. R. adds&mdash;in Sallets, or otherwise.</p>

<p>42. <em>hecheled</em>] heckled.</p>

<p>43. <em>wrapped</em>] warped.</p>

<p>51. <em>ripeled</em>, i.e. rippled; I. R. has <em>repled</em>. In l. 41 above, I. R. has <em>repealed</em>;
yet this is, I suppose, the same word.</p>

<p>53. <em>loken</em>] Locken. It means locked or tightly closed up; for <em>lock</em> was once
a strong verb.</p>

<p>57. <em>pulled</em>] culled (which is an ingenious alteration and perhaps right).</p>

<p>104. The Knight of the Tour-Landry is the book here referred to, and was one
of the books printed by Caxton. The edition printed by the Early English Text
Society, and edited by T. Wright, is so easily accessible that it is needless to say
more here than that Fitzherbert’s description of it is perfectly correct.</p>

  <div><a name="N_147" id="N_147"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>147.</b></span> 12. <em>rendit</em>] tendit. This correction may be right, but I am not sure of
it. The Leonine (or riming) verses quoted cannot be of any great antiquity, and
it is quite possible that <em>rendit</em> is intended as a Low-Latin translation of the French
<em>rend</em>, pr. s. of <em>rendre</em>. The true Latin word is, of course <em>reddit</em>; which, however,
gives no rime. Fitzherbert’s translation is intended to be in verse.</p>

  <div><a name="N_148" id="N_148"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>148.</b></span> 3. <em>brynke</em>] brim. “Better spare at brim than at bottom”; Hazlitt’s
Proverbs. And see note to Tusser, 10. 35.</p>

<p>12. <em>tedure</em>] teathure (not a good spelling.)</p>

<p>15. <em>lees</em>] ground. <em>flytte</em>] shift.</p>

<p>17. <em>tyed</em>] stakt.</p>

<p>26. <em>putteth hym in the pynfolde</em>] impoundes him.</p>

<p>38. <em>ren ryot</em>] runne.</p>

<p>43. <em>it is meruayle</em>] gracious were th<em>e</em> stars of thy natiuitie (a fine phrase!).</p>

<p><span class="fs120"><b>150, 151, 152, 153.</b></span> I. R. omits these four sections.</p>

  <div><a name="N_153" id="N_153"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>153.</b></span> 3. This quotation, from Dionysii Catonis Disticha, iii. 7, appears also in
P. Plowman, B. xii. 23.</p>

<p>28. I do not know where to find this quotation.</p>

  <div><a name="N_155" id="N_155"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>155.</b></span> 10. <em>behouable</em>] behoouefull (which is a better form).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

  <div><a name="N_156" id="N_156"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>156.</b></span> In the rubric, I. R. has&mdash;‘what riches are’; but in l. 1, he has&mdash;‘It is
now requisite to know what riches is.’ Already <em>riches</em> was becoming a plural
substantive. It may be remarked that I. R. omits the <em>Latin</em> forms of all the
quotations.</p>

  <div><a name="N_157" id="N_157"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>157.</b></span> 19. <em>duetie</em>] debt (which is what is meant). So also in ll. 22, 24.</p>

  <div><a name="N_160" id="N_160"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>160.</b></span> 2. After <em>declare</em>, I. R. inserts&mdash;and euery booke of Common prayer dooth
containe them. A pertinent remark.</p>

  <div><a name="N_161" id="N_161"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>161.</b></span> 3. I. R. omits the reference to the Athanasian Creed, and says we must
‘beleeue stedfastly the Catholick fayth.’</p>

<p>25. I. R. omits from <em>The fulfyllynge</em> to the end of the section. For a description
of the seven works of mercy, see Spenser, F. Q. 1. 10. 36.</p>

  <div><a name="N_163" id="N_163"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>163.</b></span> 3. I. R. has&mdash;and hast a stedfast fayth in Christ. He has almost wholly
rewritten this section, and says we are bound ‘to come to common prayer;’ and
omits the quotation from St. Ambrose.</p>

  <div><a name="N_164" id="N_164"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>164.</b></span> 7. It is remarkable that the author should refer us to the 3rd chapter of
Proverbs instead of the 15th. Our forefathers seem to have had no idea either of
giving a correct reference or of verifying one.</p>

<p>10. <em>Qui a</em> is printed, in Fitzherbert, as <em>Quia</em>, in one word. The correction
being obvious, I have made it.</p>

<p>18. <em>Isodorus</em>] Osorius. Why this alteration is made, I cannot tell. In l. 29
of the next section, I. R. has <em>Isidore</em>, and in l. 37, <em>Isidorus</em>.</p>

  <div><a name="N_165" id="N_165"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>165.</b></span> 39. <em>Hampole</em>] Hanapole (wrongly). Richard Rolle, of Hampole, was the
author of the Pricke of Conscience, edited by Dr. Morris for the Philological
Society, and of numerous other works, including some Religious Treatises edited
by Mr. Perry for the Early English Text Society.</p>

<p>47. I. R. omits this line; he probably did not like the word <em>oratory</em>.</p>

<p>52. The first book of Samuel was formerly called the first book of Kings.</p>

  <div><a name="N_166" id="N_166"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>166.</b></span> I. R. rewrites this section, and avoids any reference to <em>Latin</em> or to the
<em>Ave Maria</em>.</p>

  <div><a name="N_167" id="N_167"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>167.</b></span> 19, 20. I. R. gives the Latin lines, and his own translation, as follows.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">The ghostly enemy doth not stay</p>
<p class="verse0">Till tempted persons doe obey:</p>
<p class="verse0">For yeelding, hee a Lyon is,</p>
<p class="verse0">Gainestood, a flie: his pray doth misse.</p>
</div></div>

<p>His syntax is as bad as his translation.</p>

<p>34. <em>steke</em>] shutte.</p>

<p>35. <em>styfly</em>] manfully. We have here an idea which is frequently
met with in our literature. It may suffice to refer to Grosseteste’s Chastel
d’Amour, the sermon called Soules Warde printed in Dr. Morris’s Specimens of
English, part i., the extract from the Ayenbite of Inwyt printed in Morris and
Skeat’s Specimens, part ii., the Tower of Truth and Castle of Caro described in
Piers the Plowman, &amp;c. We are also reminded of Bunyan’s Holy War.</p>

  <div><a name="N_168" id="N_168"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>168.</b></span> 31. Here again Fitzherbert gives us the wrong reference to the Proverbs,
viz. to Chap. xiv. instead of Chap. xix. His reading <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veneratur dominus</i>] is
extraordinary.</p>

  <div><a name="N_169" id="N_169"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>169.</b></span> 11. <em>vnable to be foughten agaynst</em>] inuinsible.</p>

<p>13, 14. <em>slecketh</em>] slacketh. <em>slake</em>] quench.</p>

<p>35. I. R. copies Fitzherbert’s reference to Chap. 35; but read 34.</p>

  <div><a name="N_172" id="N_172"></a></div>
<p><span class="fs120"><b>172.</b></span> 14. <em>conuerted</em>] conuarted (a peculiar pronunciation).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>21. This quotation from St. Augustine appears also in Piers Plowman, B. v.
291.</p>

<p>50. This last paragraph is called by I. R. ‘Fitzherberts protestation;’ yet he
actually alters his author’s words, substituting ‘the holy scriptures’ for ‘al holy
churche,’ with various other smaller ‘corrections.’</p>

<p>To crown his effrontery, he gives the address of ‘The Authour to his Booke’
in the following extraordinary (amended) form!</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">Goe grosse fram’d image of a holy saint,</p>
<p class="verse2">present my loue, though rude my pensill paint;</p>
<p class="verse0">If any blame thee for deformitie,</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
